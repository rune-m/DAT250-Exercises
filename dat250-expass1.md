### Techinal problems
Most of the problems I encountered was related to Maven installation. Firstly, I downloaded the Maven source zip instead of the bin zip. Figured that one out after a little while. Additionally, I set the $JAVA_HOME enviroment variable to the wrong value, but figured out pretty quickly.

### Validation of software development
Validated Java using the `java -version` command. Maven with `mvn -v`.
I installed the Maven packages in the Heroku Java project and ran it locally to check that everything worked out.

### Heroku Technical Problems
No technical problems.

### Pending issues
No pending issues.
